    "1. Review or familiarize yourself with Python\n",

    "   b. SymPy module for symbolic mathematical calculations\n",
    "   c. animation capabilities\n",
    "3. Familiarize yourself with the text format and location of resources (online code, etc.)\n",
    "4. Familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebooks in case those are new (practice shortcut keys)\n",
    "5. Do some first exercises both coding to solve a problem and interpreting code and pseudocode.\n",

Simply change this to something else, like color.red. You can look up colors that are available by searching for VPython documentation online.\n",
