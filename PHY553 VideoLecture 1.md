In this video Dr Landau goes through the very basic computing concepts from language levels, components and pseudocode.
This course is formatted for Jupyter Notebook, so that's a very high end language that uses python and md to give us a very easy to read code. This video talks about JAVA which as well as python it is Object oriented so theres similarities but python is easier to read and Jupyter help so we can run lines individually.
