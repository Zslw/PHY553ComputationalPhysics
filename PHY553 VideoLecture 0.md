So Dr. Landau walks us through how the course is supposed to work and where to find the resources

Here's his webpage https://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/Books/CPbook/index.html
and book we are using https://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/Books/CPbook/eBook/Lectures/

I got a soft copy for the book [[here|Computational Physics Problem Solving... (Z-Library)]] too.

[[PHY553 Computational Physics]]
